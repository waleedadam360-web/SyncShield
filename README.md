# 🔐 SyncShield — Browser Extension for CVE-2018-5764 Detection

> **Detect unsafe Rsync commands before they become exploits**

A lightweight, privacy-focused browser extension developed as part of **Final Year Project (FYP01) NWS/129/23B** to detect missing `--protect-args` flag in Rsync commands — preventing remote command execution via **CVE-2018-5764**.

✅ Works entirely offline  
✅ No server connections or data collection  
✅ Real-time scanning & alerts  
✅ Educational & mitigation-focused  
✅ Built for students, sysadmins, and security enthusiasts

## 🎯 Project Overview

Rsync is a powerful utility for file synchronization — but if misconfigured (especially without `--protect-args`), it can lead to **remote command execution** via specially crafted filenames or arguments (CVE-2018-5764).

SyncShield helps users:
- ✅ Paste or upload Rsync commands/scripts  
- ✅ Instantly detect unsafe patterns (missing `--protect-args`, unquoted inputs, etc.)  
- ✅ Get clear, non-technical alerts and mitigation steps  
- ✅ Learn secure Rsync practices — no CLI expertise required

> ⚠️ **Scope**: Focused only on CVE-2018-5764 — simple, targeted, and achievable within academic timeline.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. Rsync Argument Analyzer
Scans user-inputted Rsync commands to detect absence of `--protect-args` — the critical flag that prevents shell injection.

### 2. Detection of Unsafe Input Patterns
Flags unquoted variables, shell metacharacters, and unsanitized user inputs that could trigger CVE-2018-5764.

### 3. Real-Time Alerts & Risk Warnings
Provides immediate visual feedback with:
- Risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Plain-language explanation
- Impact summary

### 4. Mitigation Guidance
Offers actionable fixes:

```bash
# ❌ Unsafe
rsync -av /src user@host:/dest

# ✅ Safe
rsync -av --protect-args /src user@host:/dest
```

## 📦 Why Rsync Matters & Why SyncShield is Important

### What is Rsync?
Rsync is a powerful tool used to copy and synchronize files between computers. It’s popular because it’s fast, efficient, and saves bandwidth by only transferring changes instead of the whole file.

### The Problem
If Rsync is not used carefully, it can cause serious problems:
- A wrong command could delete important files.  
- Attackers could abuse misconfigured Rsync servers to steal data.  
- Past security issues (like CVE-2018-5764) showed that Rsync can be exploited if not properly secured.

### Why SyncShield?
SyncShield helps by:
- ✅ Checking Rsync commands before running them  
- ✅ Warning users about dangerous options (like `--delete` or overwriting files)  
- ✅ Giving safety tips to prevent data loss or attacks

## 🧭 User Guide

### 1. Launch SyncShield
- Launch SyncShield from your browser’s extensions menu.  
- You’ll see three tabs: **Command Scan**, **History**, and **Info**.  
- **Default tab:** **Command Scan**

### 2. Enter Your Rsync Command
- Paste or type an `rsync` command into the **Rsync Command** box.  
- If the command is invalid or incomplete, SyncShield will warn you:  
  ⚠️ “This does not look like an rsync command.”  
- Actions:  
  - Click **🔍 Local Scan** to analyze it for unsafe patterns.  
  - Click **✨ Generate Safe** to automatically rewrite the command with `--protect-args` and other secure practices.

### 3. Build a Command (Optional)
- Not sure about syntax? Use the **Command Builder**:  
  - **Source:** Path to source files (e.g. `/path/to/source`)  
  - **Destination:** Target location (e.g. `user@host:/path/to/dest`)  
  - **Options available:**  
    - `-a` Archive  
    - `-v` Verbose  
    - `-z` Compress  
    - `--progress` Show progress  
    - `--checksum` Verify integrity  
- Click **⚡ Build Secure Command** to auto-generate a safe version.

### 4. Scan with Remote Server (Optional)
- Validate with a remote host (optional). *(This feature may require additional setup such as a URL and an access token — only use with trusted hosts.)*

### 5. Review the Results
- After scanning, review:  
  - Whether the command is **Safe** or **Unsafe**  
  - Warnings, explanations, and the impact summary  
  - Suggested fixes and a **Suggested Safe Command**  
- Actions available:  
  - **Copy** the secure command to clipboard  
  - **Export** the scan results as a file for documentation
